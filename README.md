Personal BookShelf is a ReactJS-based project designed to help users manage their virtual bookshelves. Leveraging React for the frontend and Redux for state management, this application provides an intuitive interface for searching and organizing books.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books using a search bar, which fetches real-time data from an external API.

- **View Bookshelf**: Users can access their personalized bookshelf, where all the added books are displayed.
  
- **Clear Bookshelf**: A "Clear Bookshelf" button allows users to empty their bookshelf if needed.
  
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizing local storage, added books persist even after page reloads, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface and managing components.
